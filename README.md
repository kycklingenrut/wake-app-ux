# wake-app-ux
A prototype for an alarm-app in a UX and Design course
This was a group project including me and one other person.

The objective was to prototype the ultimate alarm-app based on fictional personas that we came up with. 
The process was to follow a scaled down version of "Stanfords Design Schools - Design Thinking Bootleg".
Based of Empathy, Define, Ideate and Prototype, we took different steps forwarding our designs, testing them on real people and had a presentation about the project in the end.

The project is fully prototyped, with clickable elements.
